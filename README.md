I was inspired by my work in higher education to create a data project that identifies students who are not submitting their work. 

Students who do not submit regularily are at risk of dropping out of university and providing low feedback scores on the National Student Survey (NSS), a survey that prospective students refer to when deciding which university to go to. If the university could proactively reach out to students who are not submitting their work, they could offer them support and help them to engage in the programme. This would lead to higher feedback scores and more success stories assoicated with the university, which would improve their stance in the higher education market.

I have created tables in the file "SQL Tables" which uses dummy data similar to what might be found at a university. It contains student details and the submission status for 4 different assignments.

The file named "Identify Students To Contact - SQL" is the SQL query which outputs the students with the fewest submissions and provides their email addresses to allow staff to easily contact the students.

The file named "Part Time vs Full Time - SQL" is a SQL query which outputs whether part time students or full time students miss more submissions. This data would be useful for academic and pastoral staff to find out if there is an issue with either cohort which influences their ability to submit their work.

All data in my project is imaginary and does not have any connection to any university or students.
